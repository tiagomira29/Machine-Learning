Classification of 2D medical images from two distinct datasets: dermoscopy and blood cell microscopy.

The class labels are:
<ul>
  <li>0 nevu</li>
  <li>1 melanoma</li>
  <li>2 vascular lesions</li>
  <li>3 granulocytes</li>
  <li>4 basophils</li>
  <li>5 lymphocytes</li>
</ul>

Where the first three classes come from the dermoscopy dataset and the latter from the blood cell one.
